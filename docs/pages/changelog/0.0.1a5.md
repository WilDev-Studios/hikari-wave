# Version 0.0.1a5

Released `UNRELEASED`

## Added

- `Result` returned from all `AudioPlayer` methods, making it easy to implement further functionality.
- New `is_playing` property in `AudioPlayer`.
- Further global type checking to ensure proper data is being passed.
- New `VoiceClient`.`move` method to move channels easily.
- `FileAudioSource` raises `FileNotFoundError` if the provided filepath doesn't exist.

## Changed

- Refactored file locations for further readability and organization.

## Fixed

- Made `VoiceGateway` and `VoiceServer` connection methods idempotent, just in case they are re-called.
- Added guards on many methods to ensure object states are consistent and compliant.
- `FFmpeg` encoder/decoder is now localized to each `VoiceConnection`/`AudioPlayer`, allowing multiple voice connections with playback.

## Removed

- Convenience methods under `VoiceConnection` like `play`, `pause`, etc. in favor of clarity with `player` access.
