# Version 0.0.1a3

Released `UNRELEASED`

## Added

- `AudioPlayer`.`shuffle()` method to shuffle the queue, as well as a corresponding `VoiceConnection`.`shuffle()` for convenience.

## Changes

- Clamped dependency versions for compatibility ((Thanks [@vicky5124](https://github.com/vicky5124)) for reporting this issue).
- Switched audio dependency from `opuslib` to be fully `FFmpeg`-dependent; minor lag improvement (Thanks [@vicky5124](https://github.com/vicky5124) for recommending).
- Refactored internal client cache for slightly better lookup performance and readability.

## Fixed

- `VoiceReconnectEvent` constructor docstring return type fixed from `VoicePopulatedEvent`.
- `MemberJoinVoiceEvent`, `MemberLeaveVoiceEvent`, `MemberLeaveVoiceEvent`, `MemberDeafEvent`, and `MemberMuteEvent` now dispatch regardless if the bot is in the channel with them.

## Removed

- `VoiceActiveEvent`, `VoiceInactiveEvent`, `VoicePopulatedEvent` and `VoiceEmptyEvent` as they were redundant of logic from other events.
