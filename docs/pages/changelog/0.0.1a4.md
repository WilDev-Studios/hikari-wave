# Version 0.0.1a4

Released `UNRELEASED`

## Changed

- `AudioSource` implementations no longer require `read` or `stream` methods.
- Subsequently, `FileAudioSource` no longer requires `aiofiles` as a dependency; removed from project.

## Fixed

- `FileAudioSource` using incorrect, public `filepath` for internal equivalency check rather than private attribute.
