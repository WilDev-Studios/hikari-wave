# Version 0.0.1a4

Released `UNRELEASED`

## Added

- New `AudioSource`s:
    1. `BufferAudioSource`: Allows `bytes`-like objects to be encoded directly.
    2. `URLAudioSource`: Allows the encoding of audio hosted at an endpoint on the web.
- `__slots__` to all objects for memory efficiency.

## Changed

- `AudioSource` implementations no longer require `read` or `stream` methods.
- Subsequently, `FileAudioSource` no longer requires `aiofiles` as a dependency; removed from project.

## Fixed

- `FileAudioSource` using incorrect, public `filepath` for internal checks rather than private attribute.
- `VoiceGateway` internal gateway latency calculation not returning due to reference bug.

## Removed

- `VoiceConnection` `add_queue_file`, `remove_queue_file`, and `play_file` removed in favor of generic `add_queue`, `remove_queue`, and `play`.
